# Recognition

## Description

It's a python project for analyzing video, face detection 
and face recognition for development of a product for urban
security in zone of high stream of people and controlled
environment.

Big O notation = O(a*b)

a = number of face image to search

b = long of video to analyze

I can build this project in base to this projects:

https://github.com/techwithtim/Face-Recognition

https://github.com/FaztWeb/python-tkinter-sqlite-crud

https://www.coursera.org/learn/analyzing-video-opencv-numpy

## Requirements

If you can run it you'll need this libraries in Python 3.7:

- cmake
- dlib >= 19.7
- face_recognition
- face_recognition_models
- numpy
- opencv-python

Faces to recognition in video target must have .png or .jpg format,
each image need have one face in front position without accessories,
with the face in the most clear possible scene.

and the video could have .mp4 format.

##Usage

Use the  [git clone] 

```
git clone https://github.com/AMIRANDA9112/Recognition
```

In the console execute the index

```
python index.py
```

In few seconds later the process will plot a collage with the frames of
video, and the face detect, and the positive match recognition.
