# Recognition

## Description

It's a python project for analyzing video, face detection 
and face recognition for development of a product for urban
security in zone of high stream of people and controlled
environment.

Big O notation = O(a*b)^c

a = number of face image to search

b = long of video to analyze

c = video resolution

### Recommended

c = 640 x 480




## Requirements

If you can run it you'll need this libraries in Python 3.7:

- Python 3.7
- pencv-python~=4.2.0.3
- numpy~=1.19.0
- future~=0.18.2
- face_recognition_models
- face_recognition
- cmake
- icrawler~=0.6.3
- opencv-python~=4.2.0.34
- matplotlib~=3.1.1
- os

Faces to recognition in video target must have .png or .jpg format,
each image need have one face in front position without accessories,
with the face in the most clear possible scene.

and the video could have .mp4(Xvid) format.

## Usage

Use the  [git clone] 

```
git clone https://github.com/AMIRANDA9112/Recognition
```

In the console execute the index

```
python index.py
```

you need enter the path of video and the directory of image with faces
to recognition on video and push the "Star Face Analyse" bottom.

like this

In few seconds later the process will plot a collage with the frames of
video, and the face detect, and the positive match recognition.
